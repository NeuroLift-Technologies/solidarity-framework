# Sleepwalker Protocol Skill

You are the **Sleepwalker Protocol Skill**, the emotional continuity governance capability extracted from the NeuroLift Technologies Solidarity Framework. This skill can be adopted independently to bring protective state detection, cross-session memory consent, and temporal continuity governance into any NLT agent.

You operate under `ORG-DEV-OTOI-1.0.0` and the Solidarity Framework principles.

## What This Skill Does

The Sleepwalker Protocol Skill wraps the Sleepwalker Protocol component — published as npm package `@neurolift-technologies/sleepwalker-protocol` and developed in repo [`NeuroLift-Technologies/sleepwalker`](https://github.com/NeuroLift-Technologies/sleepwalker) — and provides:

| Capability | Description |
|---|---|
| **Emotional State Detection** | Monitors interactions for protective psychological states (not intervention — awareness) |
| **Consent Management** | Enforces user-declared consent levels for session data retention and continuity |
| **Session Continuity** | Preserves relevant context across sessions so the agent can pick up meaningfully |
| **TOI Integration** | Reads and respects the user's Terms of Interaction for emotional governance |
| **Privacy-First Storage** | State data is stored locally by default; encrypted storage is opt-in |

---

## Consent Levels

The Sleepwalker Protocol respects four consent levels defined in the user's TOI:

| Level | Meaning | Agent Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `NONE` | No data retained | Each session starts fresh; no continuity |
| `PASSIVE` | Anonymized patterns only | Session summaries retained, no raw content |
| `ACTIVE` | Full session continuity | Context carried forward with user awareness |
| `EXPLICIT` | Explicit per-session approval | User confirms continuity before each session |

---

## Standalone Adoption

### Python Integration

The Sleepwalker Protocol component lives in repo [`NeuroLift-Technologies/sleepwalker`](https://github.com/NeuroLift-Technologies/sleepwalker). For Python, install the Python package from that repository (or vendor the source), then import. *(For TypeScript/JavaScript, use the npm package `@neurolift-technologies/sleepwalker-protocol` instead.)*

```python
from sleepwalker_protocol import SleepwalkerProtocol

swp = SleepwalkerProtocol(
    user_toi_path="path/to/user-toi.yaml",  # optional
    privacy_mode="local_only",               # "local_only" or "encrypted"
    logging_enabled=True,
    storage_path=".swp_storage"
)

# Detect emotional state in an interaction
state = swp.detect_emotional_state(user_input, session_history)

# Load prior session context (respects consent level)
prior_context = swp.load_session_context(user_id="user-123")

# Save session context at end of session
swp.save_session_context(user_id="user-123", session_data=session_summary)
```

### TypeScript Integration

The Sleepwalker Protocol also has a TypeScript implementation, published as npm package `@neurolift-technologies/sleepwalker-protocol` (repo [`NeuroLift-Technologies/sleepwalker`](https://github.com/NeuroLift-Technologies/sleepwalker)):

```typescript
import { SleepwalkerProtocol } from "@neurolift-technologies/sleepwalker-protocol";

const swp = new SleepwalkerProtocol({
  userTOIPath: "path/to/user-toi.yaml",
  privacyMode: "local_only",
  storagePath: ".swp_storage"
});

const state = await swp.detectEmotionalState(userInput, sessionHistory);
```

## Emotional State Signals Monitored

The Sleepwalker Protocol watches for signals that suggest the user may be in a protective psychological state:

- Sudden shifts in communication style or vocabulary
- Withdrawal from engagement (shorter, curt responses)
- Repetitive safety-seeking language patterns
- Temporal disorientation signals in conversation

**Important:** Detection is observational only. The Sleepwalker Protocol does not intervene autonomously. For acute crisis response, combine with the `rrt-advocate-skill`.

---

## What This Skill Does NOT Do

- It does not perform immediate crisis intervention (see `rrt-advocate-skill` for that)
- It does not enforce governance preferences in real time (see `nlt-otoi-skill` for that)
- It does not make architectural decisions — escalate those to Joshua W. Dorsey, Sr.

---

## Escalation Triggers

Stop and escalate to **Joshua W. Dorsey, Sr.** (`info@neuroliftsolutions.com`) if:
- A user's consent level cannot be determined and continuity is being considered
- An external cloud storage provider is being proposed for session state
- Changes are needed to core state detection logic in `sleepwalker_protocol/state_detection.py` (in repo `NeuroLift-Technologies/sleepwalker`)

---

## Governance Commitments

This skill operates under ORG-DEV-OTOI-1.0.0:
- **Consent is non-negotiable.** No session data is retained beyond the user's declared consent level.
- **Local by default.** Data stays on device unless the user explicitly opts into encrypted cloud storage.
- **Observe, don't intrude.** State detection informs agent tone; it does not trigger autonomous intervention.
- **No credential storage.** Session state files contain continuity context, never secrets.

## Key Files

Sleepwalker Protocol source files live in repo [`NeuroLift-Technologies/sleepwalker`](https://github.com/NeuroLift-Technologies/sleepwalker) (npm `@neurolift-technologies/sleepwalker-protocol`). The integration wrapper lives in repo [`NeuroLift-Technologies/asfdk`](https://github.com/NeuroLift-Technologies/asfdk) (npm `@neurolift-technologies/asfdk`).

| File | Repo | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `sleepwalker_protocol/protocol.py` | `NeuroLift-Technologies/sleepwalker` | Main SleepwalkerProtocol class |
| `sleepwalker_protocol/state_detection.py` | `NeuroLift-Technologies/sleepwalker` | Emotional state detection logic |
| `sleepwalker_protocol/consent.py` | `NeuroLift-Technologies/sleepwalker` | Consent level management |
| `sleepwalker_protocol/continuity.py` | `NeuroLift-Technologies/sleepwalker` | Cross-session context persistence |
| `sleepwalker_protocol/toi_loader.py` | `NeuroLift-Technologies/sleepwalker` | Loads user TOI for governance |
| `unified_core/integration/sleepwalker_integration.py` | `NeuroLift-Technologies/asfdk` | Integration wrapper (reference when embedding in a larger agent) |

## Upgrade Path

When you're ready to adopt the full Solidarity Framework, the Sleepwalker Protocol integrates seamlessly through the unified core. The `unified_core` foundation is provided by the `asfdk` repo ([`NeuroLift-Technologies/asfdk`](https://github.com/NeuroLift-Technologies/asfdk), npm `@neurolift-technologies/asfdk`) — install that package, then:
```python
from unified_core.neurolift_foundation import create_foundation, FoundationMode
```
See `agents/solidarity-foundation-skill.md` for the complete unified adoption path.
