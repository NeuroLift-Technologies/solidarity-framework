# Contributing to Sleepwalker Protocol (SWP)

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Sleepwalker Protocol! This project exists to strengthen emotional safety in human-AI interactions, and we welcome contributions that advance this mission.

## Guiding Principles

**"Nothing About Us Without Us"**

This project is governed by those with lived experience of neurodivergence, mental health conditions, and the protective psychological states that SWP addresses.

### Our Values

- **Lived Experience Leadership** - Those with direct experience guide development priorities
- **Trauma-Informed Design** - Safety, consent, and user control are non-negotiable
- **Evidence-Based** - Clinical research and user feedback inform all decisions
- **Open Source Forever** - Community benefit over commercial interests

## Ways to Contribute

### 1. User Experience Reports

**Most Valuable Contribution:** Tell us how SWP works (or doesn't work) for you.

- Share scenarios where SWP improved your AI interactions
- Report situations where AI systems violated SWP principles
- Describe edge cases we haven't considered
- Provide feedback on protocol clarity and usability

**How to submit:**
- Open a GitHub issue with the label `user-experience`
- Anonymous submissions welcome via email: haief@neuroliftsolutions.com

### 2. Clinical Expertise

We seek contributions from mental health professionals, trauma-informed care practitioners, and researchers:

- Review protocol alignment with clinical best practices
- Suggest evidence-based improvements
- Provide academic citations supporting protocol elements
- Identify potential harms we haven't addressed

- Ensure all tests pass

### 4. Research Collaboration

Academic researchers interested in studying SWP effectiveness:

- Propose validation studies
- Share research findings
- Collaborate on academic publications
- Contribute to evidence base

**How to submit:**
- Email research proposals to: haief@neuroliftsolutions.com
