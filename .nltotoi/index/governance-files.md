## Purpose

This registry lists every file in this repository that is part of the ORG-DEV-OTOI-1.0.0 governance framework. It is used by:
- The `validate-governance.sh` script to verify governance completeness
- Agents performing governance audits
- The `sync-governance-public.yml` workflow to track synced files

## Sync Status

Files marked as **"Maintained in `solidarity-framework`"** are maintained directly in this repository (`NeuroLift-Technologies/solidarity-framework`) and should be edited here.

Files marked as **"Maintained in repo"** (e.g., `docs/active-threads.md`, agent log records) are managed directly in this repository by agents and maintainers.

---

## Validation

Run the governance validation script to verify all required files are present and well-formed:

```bash
bash .nltotoi/scripts/validate-governance.sh
```

The script will:
1. Check all Tier 1 and Tier 2 files exist
2. Verify JSON templates parse without errors
3. Check that `docs/active-threads.md` is not stale (>30 days without update)
4. Report any missing or malformed governance files

---

## Adding a New Governance File

To add a new file to the governance framework:

1. Create a `governance-proposal` GitHub Issue describing the new file
2. Await Joshua W. Dorsey, Sr.'s approval
3. Add the file to `NeuroLift-Technologies/solidarity-framework` (canonical source)
4. Update this registry in `.nltotoi/index/governance-files.md`
